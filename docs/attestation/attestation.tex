\section{Introduction}

\section{Privacy Certificate Authority Based Attestation}

There are two versions of the Privacy CA attestation process, one
documented by~\citet{Ryan:09:Introduction-to} and the other documented
in the TCG specification \citep{---::TCG-TPM-Specifi}.  They are not
dramatically different, but should be reconciled.

\subsection{The Ryan Approach}

The Ryan protocol, shown in figure~\ref{fig:ryan-ca}, is documented in
his invaluable technical report~\cite{Ryan:09:Introduction-to}.  We
have enhanced it here to include more explicit interaction between the
appraiser and the user software.  

\begin{enumerate}
  \parskip=0pt\itemsep=0pt
\item An appraiser sends an attestation request indicating what PCRs
  are needed using a $PCR$ mask along with a nonce, $n$.\footnote{This
  request is not formally documented, but its specifics are not
  critical for this discussion.}

\item The user software receives the request and requests a fresh AIK
  from the TPM, wrapped with the TPM's SRK using the
  \verb+TPM_MakeIdentity+ command.  Parameters to the
  \verb+TPM_MakeIdentity+ command describe properties of the desired
  AIK pair and include a digest of the CA and Label identifying the
  target CA ($CA_d$).  

\item The TPM responds to the \verb+TPM_MakeIdentity+ command by
  generating a new AIK wrapped by SRK and returns the new wrapped AIK
  along with $idContents$ containing $CA_d$ and $\public{AIK}$ signed
  by $\private{AIK}$.

  \emph{The new AIK is a key wrapped by SRK and can only be installed
    on the TPM associated with SRK.  Thus, the only way that
    $\sign{CA_d,\public{AIK}}{AIK}$ can be created is in the presence
    of the TPM that generated AIK.}

\item The user software sends a certified public EK ($\sign{EK}{AIK}$)
  and the $idContents$ ($\sign{CA_d,\public{AIK}}{AIK}$) obtained from
  the TPM to the Privacy CA and requests that it certify
  $\public{AIK}$.

  \emph{It is not clear where the certified public EK is obtained, but
    the public EK is available to the CA in many different fashions.}

\item The Privacy CA uses $\public{AIK}$ to check the signature on
  $\public{EK}$ and then determines if the $EK$ has been revoked.  It
  then uses $\public{AIK}$ to check the signature on
  $idContents$. \emph{If $idContents$ signature check and EK signature
    check succeed, the Privacy CA knows the $\public{AIK}$, $CA_d$ and
    $\public{EK}$ came from the same TPM.}  It then uses its own
  public key and name to regenerate $CA_d$ and compare with the signed
  $CA_d$ sent to it.  \emph{If the generated digest is the same as the
    received digest, the CA knows the certification request is
    intended for it.} If all three checks are successful -- EK
  signature, $idContents$ signature, and $CA_d$ generation -- the
  Privacy CA signs the public AIK and encrypts the AIK certificate
  with a fresh session key.  It they encrypts both the session key and
  the certified $\public{AIK}$ with $\public{EK}$ and returns both to
  the user software.  \emph{Only the TPM with $\private{EK}$ can
    decrypt this package, ensuring that only the TPM that generated
    the request can decrypt the response.}

\item The user software uses the \verb+TPM_ActivateIdentity+ command
  to decyrpt the session key ($\encrypt{K}{EK}$).  \emph{Only the TPM
    associated with $\private{EK}$ can decrypt the session key.}  The
  user software then in turn decrypts the signed AIK
  ($\encrypt{\sign{AIK}{CA}}{K}$) using $K$.  \emph{The $\public(AIK)$
    signed by the Privacy CA ($\sign{\public{AIK}}{CA}$) can only be
    obtained in the presence of the TPM associated with EK.}

\item The user software requests a quote signed with $\private{AIK}$
  from the TPM using the \verb+TPM_Quote+ command and the nonce, $n$,
  sent by the appraiser.  The TPM produces the quote, signed using
  $\private{AIK}$.  \emph{This ensures the quote comes from the holder
    of $\private{AIK}$.}  $\sign{\public{AIK}}{CA}$ is also signed
  with $\private{AIK}$.  \emph{This ensures the certified public AIK
    comes from the only TPM that could decrypt it.}  The user software
  sends the signed, certified AIK and signed quote back to the
  appraiser.\footnote{The details of this communication are not
    specified.}

\item The appraiser analyzes the signed blobs received from the user
  software as follows: 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\public{AIK}$ is used to check the signature of
    $\sign{\sign{\public{AIK}}{CA}}{AIK}$ --- The $AIK$ was signed by
    the TPM where the $AIK$ is installed.
    
  \item $\public{CA}$ is used to check the signature of
    $\sign{\public{AIK}}{CA}$ --- The Privacy CA has certified the AIK
    is installed in a legitimate TPM.  The session key encrypting the
    certificate can only be decrypted by the TPM making the
    certification request.
  
  \item $\public{AIK}$ is used to check the quote signature --- The
    quote sent was signed by the TPM where the AIK is installed and
    the same TPM that generated the signature on
    $\sign{\sign{\public{AIK}}{CA}}{AIK}$
      
  \item $n$ is checked against the nonce sent with the original
    request --- The TPM quote is fresh, avoiding a replay attack using
    a cached quote.
    
  \item PCRs from the quote are compared with expected values --- The
    remote system is configured as expected.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{TCG Documentation Approach}

The TCG protocol is documented in the TPM technical documentation by
way of describing the TPM command set
provided~\citep{---::TCG-TPM-Specifi}.  At this time, the distinction
is the \verb+TPM_MakeIdentity+ command returning a signed public
$\public{EK}$ in addition to the signed $\public{AIK}$.  If we can
determine that this is the same as the certification request ($CR$),
then the two protocols are basically the same.
