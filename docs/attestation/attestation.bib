	Abstract = {The semantics of C is described in the ANSI/ISO standard using
natural language. This
paper contains a brief summary, more descriptive than technical, of
our research in specifying
a complete and accurate formal semantics for ANSI C. We follow the
denotational
approach and divide the specification in three distinct phases:
static, typing and dynamic
semantics. Moreover, we have developed a direct implementation of the
semantics, using
the programming language Haskell. We argue that our formal
specification results in a better
understanding of the semantics of ANSI C and comment on its
readability, precision,
abstraction and applications.},

  structures. It focuses on the problem where a programmer wants to
  operate only on a small subset of the datatype, leaving a large
  portion of the value untouched. To do this, it makes an algebra a
  first class object and uses the record syntax to replace specific
  elements of the algebra. This leads to definition of some algebra
  combinators. The authors spend a fair amount of time analyzing ways
  to combine monadic algebras. 

This work operates on a recursively
  defined datatype, not using the functorized version as found in
  Duponcheel and Gayo's work.}},
