We have submitted a paper on protocol verification using a state monad
to Formal Methods 2014.  In this work we generalized the approach used
for attestation protocol verification to include other protocols,
specifically migration protocols.  The submitted version is available
on our [publications page]({{ site.baseurl }}publications.html).
