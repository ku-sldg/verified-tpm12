title: Verified TPM
---

The goal of the Verified TPM is specifying and verifying the TPM 1.2 formally in
PVS.  We specify the TPM as a state transformation system with each
instruction modifying the TPM state.  We then use a state monad to
sequence instruction execution, threading state through a sequence of
instructions.
